1. Test Cases are available in Report Folder
2. Automation Results are available in test-Output Folder


Points to Gear Up :

1. The Client side rendering can be improved
2. More Colorful UI can be introduced
3. Buttons Like Read more and others must have a contrast colors to make it more visible for Users
4. For Tags based Search for more accurate results Elastic search could be implemented with enhancements.
	 Need to improved the ability of Search.

	 
	 
	 TO Run the Automation Just Run the TestNg.xml file and You are done :)
